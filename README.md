# Teletortoise

This is a [Play](https://www.playframework.com/) application that allows you to use your browser to interact with an instance of classic NetLogo that is running on a server.

Related is [NetLogo Web](https://github.com/NetLogo/Tortoise/) (formerly known as "Tortoise"), which is a JavaScript-based version of NetLogo that runs entirely in the client's browser.  NetLogo Web can most easily be used through through [the Galapagos web application](https://github.com/NetLogo/Galapagos/).

For more information about the Tortoise project in general, see [here](https://github.com/NetLogo/NetLogo/wiki/Tortoise).
